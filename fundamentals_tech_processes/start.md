## üß† Course Introduction: Fundamentals of Technological Processes

The *Fundamentals of Technological Processes* course (codes 02GZYYU, 02GZYUU) is a cornerstone of the Quantum Engineering Master's programme at Politecnico di Torino. It provides a robust foundation in micro- and nano-fabrication techniques, cryogenic technologies, and superconductivity‚Äîessential areas for the design and manufacturing of quantum devices, including sensors and communication systems.

Led by Professor Matteo Cocuzza, an expert in nanotechnologies and microsystems design , the course delves into the physical and chemical behaviours of materials at micro- and nano-scales, especially under cryogenic conditions. Students will explore process flows, material selection, and fabrication techniques crucial for developing miniaturised quantum devices.([polito.it][1])
